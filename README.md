# iterative-towers-of-hanoi
an iterative solution to towers of hanoi

this attempt uses a disk movement sequence generation algorithm based on the number of disks

viability unknown

update 1.01: disk movement sequence generation successful, testing phase complete.

we now know which disk to move at every turn

next step is to figure out which pole to move each disk to
